# Rule 1: If Priority(A) > Priority(B), A runs (B doesnâ€™t).
# Rule 2: If Priority(A) = Priority(B), A & B run in RR.
# Rule 3: When a job enters the system, it is placed at the highest priority (the topmost queue).
# Rule 4: Once a job uses up its time allotment at a given level (regardless of how many times
#         it has given up the CPU), its priority is reduced (i.e., it moves down one queue).
# Rule 5: After some time period S, move all the jobs in the system to the topmost queue
